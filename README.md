# TriviaGame
Trivia Game is a simple timed trivia application.

## Summary
The trivia game is composed of 5 questions, each with 4 potential answers. The player has 20 seconds to answer a question. After a player has submitted a guess or time runs out, the correct answer is displayed for 5 seconds. At the end of the game, the total number of correct answers is displayed and the player has the option to play again.

## UI Features
At the top of the gameboard, the total number of questions are displayed as small round pips. This question tracker pip changes color to indicate the current question (e.g. Question #3 has 3 highlighted pips).

When a player selects an answer, the answer box changes to a dark blue. If the player decides to choose a different answer before hitting submit, only the most recently selected answer will display as dark blue.
